# Pirate-Game
Completed as a final in-class project for grade 12 computer science class.  Code is in Java and was completed independently.
For this project I used JavaFX to create the game and leaderboard screen and coded everything in Java.
The .wav file titled "PirateSong.wav" was too large to include in both resources folders, but for reference it was in the in both the src and bin resource folders.
